# Copy ChatGPT LaTeX

The Copy ChatGPT LaTeX Extension is a tool that allows users to easily copy LaTeX in firefox. 

The extension will be available by a link here as soon as it is available. 


This work is forked from of this a different extension that is [available in the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-equation-renderer/nkkkaendbndanjjndfpebmekhgdjlhkh?hl). 

The goal is just to copy equations in firefox as ChatGPT renders LaTeX. This code looks a bit differently and removes the renderer code as it is no longer needed. 

Please feel free to incorporate any of the changes in the repo into the original project or to add any improvements. If I consider it worthwhile I will merge them and republish the extension.
